The code provided is a collection of C++ files that define a simple state machine called 'picomachine'. It uses CMake to build the project and is designed to be used with the Pico SDK, which targets the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The project is structured with the following files:

    CMakeLists.txt: This file defines the build configuration for the project, setting compiler options, including external libraries, and adding subdirectories for the different modules.

    picomachine.h: This file is the main header for the 'picomachine' project and includes the headers for the 'monitor' and 'event' modules.

    debug/debug.h: This file defines a debug logging function that is only active when the PICOMACHINE_DEBUG_MODE flag is enabled.

    event/CMakeLists.txt: This file defines the build configuration for the 'event' module, which includes a static library with the 'event' class and its methods.

    event/event.h and event/event.cpp: These files define the 'Event' class, which provides static methods to control the state of a machine (start, stop, pause, and restart).

    event/event.tpp: This file contains the template implementations of the 'Event' class methods.

    monitor/monitor.h and monitor/monitor.cpp: These files define the 'Machine' class, which represents a simple state machine with various states (idle, running, starting, stopping, and wait). The class also manages an LED color property, which changes according to the machine's state.

The state machine ('Machine' class) can be started, stopped, paused, and restarted using the methods from the 'Event' class. The machine's state and LED color can be accessed and modified using the 'Machine' class methods. The machine's state is represented by an enumeration (State), and the LED color is represented by another enumeration (LED_Color). The 'Machine' class also provides methods to get the elapsed time the machine has been running and the elapsed time it has been idle.

The 'debug' module provides a debug logging function that can be used throughout the project. When the PICOMACHINE_DEBUG_MODE flag is enabled, this function prints debug messages to the console, which can be useful during development and testing.
