## Requirements

To use the source code (here), you will probably need:

- bash/sh/zsh
- pico-sdk
- arm-none-eabi GCC
- arm-none-eabi GDB 
- cppcheck 
- cmake (3.12 or newer) 
- libc++
- glibc


## Building

It is assumed you are using `bash` or a POSIX compliant shell. Source the environment variables
file with 

```bash 
source ./env_setup.sh
```

and from then on the command `build` called in any of the folders or subdirectory will be accessible
as a means of compiling, debugging, and flashing code for the keypad. 

To find out information about this command, `build help` has been provided.
